## Question 1

Reading in the Mr. Trash Wheel data from the first excel sheet titled "Mr. Trash Wheel" as well as 
  * Omitting non-data entries 
  * Cleaning the names of variables
  * Omitting rows not including dumpster-specific data
  * Rounding the "Sports Ball" variable to the nearest integer and converting it to an integer variable using as.integer

```{r}
library(readxl)

Trash_Wheel_data = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", 
  col_names = TRUE, 
  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", 
  skip = 1, 
  range = "A2:N336") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```
